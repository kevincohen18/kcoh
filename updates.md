Kevin — I pulled your site and here’s what I’d improve, in priority order.

## 1) Fix credibility leaks (these hurt conversions fast)

* Your “proof” metrics look like placeholders / unverifiable marketing numbers: “1M+ Lines of Code”, “500+ Commits This Year”, “99.9% Uptime”, “99.9% Project Success” on the homepage. If you can’t *back them*, delete or replace with verifiable proof (App Store links, client logos, testimonials, case studies). ([kcoh.ca][1])
* Your About page shows “100+ Projects / 50+ Clients / 10+ Apps”… but later shows **0** for “Projects Shipped / Happy Clients / Apps on App Store” (that’s a straight-up trust killer). Fix the counters or remove the section. ([kcoh.ca][2])

## 2) Make the site about buyer outcomes, not “dev vibes”

[Inference] The terminal / “whoami” / “code showcase” sections are cool for engineers, but most buyers want: **what you build, for who, how fast, and what it costs**. Right now the site leans heavy into aesthetics (“real code”, “contribution activity”, “customize your name”) instead of buyer clarity. ([kcoh.ca][1])
**Replace/reshape with:**

* 3 clear packages (e.g., “MVP in 4–6 weeks”, “iOS app build”, “Web + API build”) + what’s included
* 2–4 **case studies** (problem → solution → tech → measurable result)
* A short “Process” section (Discovery → Build → Launch) that matches how you actually work ([kcoh.ca][2])

## 3) Portfolio page is too thin to sell you

Your portfolio page reads like placeholders (“Mobile App”, “Enterprise Platform”) and mostly punts people to kevincohen.ca. Add real projects *on kcoh.ca* with:

* 1 image, 3 bullets (impact), stack, and “View on App Store / Live demo / GitHub (if public)”
* Results (downloads, retention, revenue, time saved, etc.) if you’re allowed to share ([kcoh.ca][3])

## 4) Contact form friction: you’re losing leads

You require **Phone***. That’s unnecessary friction for inbound (especially SMBs). Make phone optional, add “Budget range” dropdown, and give a direct “Book a call” link that actually schedules (Calendly or similar). ([kcoh.ca][4])

## 5) Services page: tighten positioning

The services list is fine, but it’s generic (“React/Vue/Angular… AWS/Azure/GCP…”). Pick a sharper positioning like:

* “iOS-first product studio” + “full-stack delivery when needed”
* 2–3 target client types (founders, SMBs, internal product teams)
  Then align the services copy to those buyers. ([kcoh.ca][5])

If you want, paste your homepage HTML here (or tell me what stack you used), and I’ll give you a concrete rewrite of:

* hero section
* proof block (what to replace the stats with)
* portfolio layout that actually closes leads

Kevin — here’s a clean **recommended fixes + TODO list** (ordered by impact). Everything below is based on what’s currently on kcoh.ca.

## P0 — Must fix (trust + conversions)

* **Remove or verify homepage “proof” stats**
  Replace “1M+ lines of code / 500+ commits / 99.9% uptime / 99.9% success” with proof you can back (App Store links, client quotes, case studies, real metrics).
* **Fix the About page counter contradiction**
  “100+ projects / 50+ clients / 10+ apps” but also “0 projects shipped / 0 happy clients / 0 apps on App Store” = instant distrust. Make them consistent or delete the section.
* **Contact form: make phone optional**
  Mandatory phone kills leads. Also add “Budget range” + “Timeline” dropdowns.

## P1 — High impact (clarity + selling)

* **Rewrite hero into buyer outcomes**
  Replace dev-style copy with: who you help + what you deliver + timeframe + CTA (“Book a call” / “Get estimate”).
* **Add 2–4 real case studies** (even if small)
  Each: problem → solution → stack → result → link/demo/screens. Put these on the homepage + portfolio.
* **Portfolio: remove placeholders**
  Replace generic tiles (“Mobile App”, “Enterprise Platform”) with real projects + screenshots + outcome bullets.

## P2 — Medium (positioning + polish)

* **Services page: narrow positioning**
  Stop listing every framework/cloud like a template. Pick your main lane (ex: iOS + product MVPs) and write it for specific buyers.
* **Add a simple “Process” section**
  Discovery → Build → Ship → Support. People buy process clarity.
* **Add social proof blocks**
  Testimonials, logos, “worked with”, or even professor/club/org endorsements if client NDA blocks you.

## P3 — Nice-to-have (conversion tuning)

* **Add scheduling CTA** (Calendly/Cal.com)
  Put “Book a 15-min call” in header + contact section.
* **Add pricing anchors**
  Even ranges (“MVP builds start at $X”) filters tire-kickers and boosts qualified leads.

### Quick 7-day execution plan

**Day 1:** Delete/replace fake stats + fix About counters
**Day 2:** Make phone optional + add Budget/Timeline
**Days 3–4:** Build 2 case study pages + homepage “Featured work”
**Day 5:** Rewrite hero + tighten services positioning
**Days 6–7:** Add process + testimonials + scheduling CTA

If you paste what you actually want to sell (1–2 sentences: “I build X for Y”), I’ll rewrite your **hero + services intro + CTA copy** in your site’s tone.
