Perfect. Below is a **full, implementation-grade instruction document** you can give directly to your AI agent (Cursor / Devin / custom agent).
It encodes **everything we’ve established**, including positioning, tone, structure, constraints, and success criteria.

This is written as a **system brief + execution spec**, not marketing fluff.

---

# 📘 SYSTEM INSTRUCTION DOCUMENT

**Project:** KCOH.ca – Business Systems Engineering Website
**Owner:** Kevin Cohen (KCOH ©️)
**Goal:** Turn kcoh.ca into a high-trust, high-conversion site for **business clients** (SMBs → large) seeking **software systems for scale**, not generic development services.

---

## 1. CORE IDENTITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1.1 What KCOH Is

KCOH is **not** a generic software development studio.

KCOH is a:

> **Business Systems Engineering practice** that designs and builds software to scale operations, finance, workflows, and decision-making for businesses.

This identity must be reflected **everywhere** in copy, structure, and CTAs.

---

### 1.2 What KCOH Is NOT

The site must **avoid**:

* Freelancer language
* Resume-style tech stacks
* “I build apps for everyone”
* Feature-centric selling
* Individual / consumer framing

---

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCE (STRICT)

### 2.1 Primary Audience

**Businesses with operational complexity**, including:

* Scaling SMBs
* Online businesses
* Ops-heavy companies
* Internal product teams
* Founders past the “idea” stage

These businesses:

* Already generate revenue
* Have workflows, money movement, clients, inventory, or compliance
* Are bottlenecked by manual or fragile systems

### 2.2 Explicitly Excluded

The site should quietly repel:

* Personal projects
* Hobby apps
* “Just a website” requests
* Budget shoppers
* Individual consumers

---

## 3. POSITIONING STATEMENT (SOURCE OF TRUTH)

The AI agent must treat the following as the **conceptual anchor**:

> “I replace manual, fragile business processes with scalable software systems.”

Every section must reinforce:

* leverage
* automation
* clarity
* scale
* real-world business constraints (finance, regulation, ops)

---

## 4. CORE DIFFERENTIATOR (VERY IMPORTANT)

Kevin Cohen is **not just a developer**.

He is:

* A **small business owner since 2020**
* Who **scaled a virtual goods business to seven figures**
* By automating **finance, operations, inventory, support, and sales logic**
* Supporting **2,500+ clients**
* With **high retention and minimal manual intervention**

The site must **explicitly surface this operator experience**.

This is the primary credibility moat.

---

## 5. SITE ARCHITECTURE (REQUIRED)

### Required Pages / Sections

1. Homepage
2. Services / Engagements
3. Case Studies (Systems)
4. How It Works
5. About (Operator-focused)
6. Contact / System Discussion

No filler pages. No blog required.

---

## 6. HOMEPAGE IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

### 6.1 Hero Section (MANDATORY STRUCTURE)

The hero must contain **all four**:

1. Who it’s for → *Businesses*
2. What is fixed → *Manual / messy systems*
3. Outcome → *Scale, clarity, leverage*
4. CTA → *Discussion, not “contact”*

**Tone:**
Calm, confident, senior, systems-oriented.
No hype. No buzzwords.

**Prohibited in hero:**

* Tech stacks
* Years of experience
* Generic slogans
* “Full-stack developer”

---

### 6.2 “What I Do” Section

Describe **systems**, not features.

Focus on:

* Workflow automation
* Financial visibility
* Operational tooling
* Decision support
* Internal platforms

Use outcome language:

* “reduce manual intervention”
* “eliminate operational blind spots”
* “scale without adding headcount”

---

### 6.3 Credibility Block (Operator Proof)

Must explicitly mention:

* 7-figure business scaling
* Automation replacing manual ops
* 2,500+ clients supported
* Finance + inventory + workflow logic

No fake metrics. No vanity stats.

---

## 7. SERVICES / ENGAGEMENTS PAGE

### 7.1 Productized Engagements (MAX 2–3)

Each engagement must include:

* Who it’s for
* What business problem it solves
* What changes after delivery
* Typical engagement scope

**Examples (conceptual, not copy):**

* Business Systems Build
* Operational Automation & Tooling
* iOS + Backend Systems for Business Ops

Avoid:

* “Web development”
* “Mobile development”
* Laundry lists of frameworks

---

## 8. CASE STUDIES (SYSTEMS, NOT APPS)

### 8.1 Case Study Template (STRICT)

Each case study must follow this structure:

1. **Context**

   * Type of business
   * Scale / complexity

2. **Problem**

   * Manual processes
   * Operational bottlenecks
   * Financial blind spots

3. **System Built**

   * Automation
   * Dashboards
   * Workflow logic
   * Internal tools

4. **Result**

   * Reduced manual work
   * Improved clarity
   * Enabled scale
   * Higher retention / reliability

5. **Technology (last)**

   * Mentioned only after business value

Minimum: **3 case studies**

---

## 9. HOW IT WORKS PAGE

### Required Steps (aligned to Kevin’s thinking)

1. Understand the system
2. Identify leverage
3. Design & build automation
4. Ship, support, iterate

This section exists to:

* Reduce buyer anxiety
* Signal predictability
* Show seniority

---

## 10. ABOUT PAGE (OPERATOR FIRST)

The About page must:

* Lead with business ownership & scaling
* Emphasize systems thinking
* Mention shipping real software under real constraints
* De-emphasize academic or junior signals

This is **not** a biography.
It is a **credibility narrative**.

---

## 11. CONTACT → “SYSTEM DISCUSSION”

### 11.1 CTA Language

Replace “Contact” with:

* “Discuss Your Operations”
* “Review Your Systems”
* “See Where Automation Makes Sense”

### 11.2 Form Requirements

* Phone: optional
* Required fields:

  * Business type
  * Current bottleneck
  * Timeline
* Optional:

  * Revenue range

Goal: qualify serious businesses only.

---

## 12. PRICING SIGNALS (ANTI-FREELANCER)

The site must include **pricing anchors**, even if vague:

* “Engagements typically start at $X”
* “Best fit for revenue-generating businesses”
* “Not for one-off or hobby projects”

This protects positioning.

---

## 13. TONE & STYLE GUIDELINES

* Calm, precise, confident
* No hype language
* No emojis
* No “passion” fluff
* No buzzwords
* Business-first language
* Systems > features
* Outcomes > tools

---

## 14. SUCCESS CRITERIA (MEASURABLE)

After implementation:

* The site should **repel** low-budget individuals
* Conversations should start at **operations & systems**, not “what stack”
* Pricing resistance should decrease
* Leads should reference:

  * automation
  * scaling
  * workflows
  * finance
  * leverage

If the site still attracts “how much per hour?” questions → **FAILURE**

---

## 15. FINAL RULE (VERY IMPORTANT)

If there is ever a conflict between:

* looking impressive to developers
  vs
* being clear and credible to business decision-makers

**Always choose the business decision-maker.**
