Here is a **clean, structured TODO list** you can send directly to your agent.
This is written as **execution instructions**, not discussion.

Everything below assumes the goal is to **sell you as a trusted operator who built and ran real systems**, not an agency.

---

## OBJECTIVE

Reposition kcoh.ca to clearly present Kevin as:

* The owner and operator of real production systems
* Someone trusted by thousands of real users
* Someone who understands operations, payments, automation, and scale
* Not a generic software agency or consulting team

The site must prioritize **trust, ownership, and judgment** over features or buzzwords.

---

## GLOBAL RULES (NON NEGOTIABLE)

Agent must follow these rules everywhere:

1. Never imply a team unless explicitly stated as solo led
2. Never imply client consulting history that does not exist
3. Always anchor credibility in systems Kevin personally built and operated
4. Use I when describing work and ownership
5. Avoid corporate or MBA language
6. Avoid buzzwords and agency speak
7. Avoid hyphens or dash punctuation in all copy
8. Write like a calm senior operator explaining real work
9. Prefer plain language over clever language

---

## PHASE 1 POSITIONING RESET

### TODO 1 Define core positioning line

Create one short sentence used consistently across the site that communicates:

* Built and operated real systems
* Focus on automation and operational clarity
* Business outcomes over features

Example direction only
I build and operate software systems that replace manual work and give businesses clear visibility into how they run

Propose three variants. Select one.

---

### TODO 2 Remove agency framing

Scan the entire site and remove or rewrite:

* We
* Our team
* Senior engineers
* Studio
* Enterprise builds
* Consulting language

Replace with:

* I
* Built and operated by me
* Systems I run or ran
* KCOH Software Inc led by me where needed

---

## PHASE 2 HOMEPAGE FIXES

### TODO 3 Rewrite hero section

Hero must clearly state:

* Who it is for
  Businesses with real operations
* What problem is solved
  Manual workflows and unclear data
* Why trust exists
  Built and operated systems used by thousands
* CTA
  Discuss your systems or similar

Deliverables:

* Hero headline
* Subheadline
* Primary CTA text

---

### TODO 4 Proof section alignment

Ensure the three proof cards only communicate:

* Owned products
* Operated systems
* Production experience

No client delivery claims.
No agency framing.

---

## PHASE 3 SYSTEMS BUILT SECTION

### TODO 5 Rename section

Change section title to:

Systems I Built and Operated

Add a short subline:
Real production systems with real constraints and measurable outcomes

---

### TODO 6 Rewrite all three system cards

Each card must include:

* Clear ownership language
* Plain English explanation
* Outcomes that feel lived in
* No jargon

Use the latest approved copy that removes headcount references entirely.

---

### TODO 7 Add credibility clarification

Add one small low contrast line under the section:

These systems were built and operated in production by me. Metrics are real and anonymized.

---

## PHASE 4 ABOUT PAGE CLEANUP

### TODO 8 Simplify About page structure

Reduce About page to:

* Short introduction
* Operator background
* What systems Kevin builds
* Why businesses hire him
* CTA

Remove:

* Skill meters
* Progress bars
* Long tech lists
* Decorative metrics without context

---

### TODO 9 Rewrite About narrative

About page must emphasize:

* Ownership
* Accountability
* Operating under real constraints
* Learning from scale and failure

Avoid:

* Exploration language
* Learning language
* Experimentation framing

---

## PHASE 5 TECH STACK DE EMPHASIS

### TODO 10 Demote tech stack

Ensure tech stack:

* Is secondary
* Is short
* Supports credibility but does not lead

Allowed emphasis:

* Swift
* SwiftUI
* CloudKit
* Live databases

Avoid long lists and percentages.

---

## PHASE 6 CONVERSION AND BOOKING

### TODO 11 Align booking language

Update booking links and copy to avoid:

* Consultation
* Free advice
* Sales language

Use:

* System discussion
* Operational review
* Fit conversation

Ensure the Cal description matches this tone.

---

### TODO 12 CTA consistency check

Every CTA must imply:

* Review
* Fit
* Understanding systems

No CTAs should imply quick builds or generic quotes.

---

## PHASE 7 FINAL REVIEW CHECKLIST

Before shipping, agent must verify:

* Nothing implies a team that does not exist
* Nothing implies consulting history that did not happen
* The strongest proof is visible within ten seconds
* Language feels calm and confident
* The site attracts operators, not hobbyists

If any item fails, revise.

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The work is successful if:

* People reference Kevin’s platform experience on calls
* Conversations focus on workflows and systems, not features
* Fewer low quality inquiries
* No one asks how big the team is

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION TO AGENT

Do not optimize for sounding impressive.
Optimize for sounding trustworthy.

Ownership beats scale.
Clarity beats polish.
Reality beats marketing.
